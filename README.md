Objective:
The objective of this assignment is to build a weather application using OpenWeatherMap API that allows users to check the current weather and forecast for a given location through the command line.

Task:

Create a new OpenWeatherMap account and obtain the necessary API key

Build a command-line Java application that prompts the user to enter a location (e.g. city, zip code)

The application should use the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve current weather and forecast data for the given location

The application should display the current weather conditions, such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed, as well as a forecast for the next five days

The application should handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful feedback to the user

Deliverable:

A working command-line Java application that can be run on a local machine

A detailed documentation of your application including the technologies used, API usage and instructions on how to run the application

Time Estimate: 8 hours

Note:
OpenWeatherMap has some usage policies and rate limits, so make sure to read and follow them.
